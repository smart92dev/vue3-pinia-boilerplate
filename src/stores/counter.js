  // asynchronous, you can `await` inside of actions any API call or even other 
  // actions! Here is an example using Mande. Note the library you use doesn't 
  // matter as long as you get a Promise, you could even use the 
  // native fetch function (browser only):
  actions: {
    increment() {
      this.counter++;
    },
